Hello my name is Tolebay Arsen i am a student of se 2001
My topic is Telegram bot.
So i have created a bot called CS pedia
This is a bot that show an information about CS:GO
teams and pro gamers

Commands
My bot has 4 commands they are:
/start  -  To start the bot
/help  -  the list of commands
/go  -  to enter names of teams or gamers
/defuse  -  to rate the bot


first 2 days i was choosing topic to my project
third day i choosed programming language. I choosed python and Used PyCharm
from 11 - 16 november i had been learning. I readed documentation telegram Api and watched videos on youtube
next days i was creating main mechanism and filling data
to fill data about gamers and teams i used sites like hltv.org and liquipedia.net



problems i faced

when i created keyboard and click one of them then if i click second keyboard it wasnt read it and always was taking data of first keyboard 

also it was problematic to send stickers

Python is a new programming language for me thats why i had a lot of problem with syntax

so now i have finished my project and 
these 2 weeks were very interesting. So now i've learned some function on python and learned to create telegram bot. Also i have learned some term word related to IT sphere such as API , token and etc.
